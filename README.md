This project was created in fall 2014 at LUT on www course as a second assignment. The main point of the assignment was to show a knowledge of all things in HTML + php + sql. The game can be run by placing the contents in a local server. If you want to test multiplayer, run server.js with node.js, and put the right ip address in client.js. 

Game showcases a knowledge of webgl (three.js + physijs), node.js sockets, sql, HTML5 techniques and jquery

Project has a README.html in frontend directory, which tells how game is written. ItÂ´s a finnish project report for a course assistant.
